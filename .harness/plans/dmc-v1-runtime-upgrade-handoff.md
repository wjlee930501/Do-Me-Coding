# HANDOFF — dmc-v1-runtime-upgrade (session → session)

Date: 2026-07-07 (rev 6 — M8 host install/adaptation shipped + CLOSED; M6.5 closed earlier the
same session-day at rev 5) · Branch: `claude/dmc-v1-runtime-upgrade-c5uch1`
Session end state: milestone `HEAD` == `origin` == `39c420e` (pushed, fast-forward, no force; this
handoff lands as the following docs commit). M8 CLOSED: live post-commit `bin/dmc selftest --all`
on the real committed tree `39c420e` exits 0 at legacy `tools=49 / PASS=802 / FAIL=3 / N/A=3` ==
pinned baseline EXACTLY (originals-alone reproduce it), all sections 0 FAIL incl. the NEW
`doctor` 24/0 + `m8-suite` 126/0 (roundtrip 83 · idempotency 17 · doctor-negcontrols 16 ·
manifest-drift 10) and the M6.5 sections, `SELFTEST-ALL RESULT: PASS`. Verification chain: critic
r1 REJECT (5 blockers) → Rev 2 → r2 REJECT (B1–B5 closed; new B6 `.codex` provenance) → Rev 3 →
r3 APPROVE → human gate (A1/A2/A3 advisory dispositions recorded; A3 sentinel-not-gitignored
MANDATORY) → parallel build T013.1–.4 → T013.5 evidence/verification (replica `--all` 802/3/3) →
critic r4 build sign-off APPROVE (0 blockers) → independent verifier ACCEPT (own replica `--all`
802/3/3 EXACT; 0 blocking / 5 advisory). Post-commit `verify-crosscheck` ACCEPT + `stop-gate quick`
STOP-PASS (the pre-commit REFUSE hold cleared at the commit exactly as designed). No active run
(pointer cleared; all five run dirs archived SUSPENDED). Worktree clean except local-only run
archives/auto-logs (untracked by policy); `main` untouched (`main` == `origin/main` == `d0edc48`).
Prior states: rev 5 — M6.5 CLOSED at `8a97e43` (Option A advisory shims); rev 4 — M6 CLOSED at
`d721487` (both closure proofs).

| M7, M9, M10 | **NOT STARTED, NOT APPROVED** | — | master plan §Execution Tasks (Rev 3) remaining order: M7→M9→M10 |

Approval state (master plan `## Approval Status`, updated at `39c420e`): **APPROVED
M2+M3+M4+M5 (M1 retroactively ratified) · M6, M6.5, and M8 each via their own milestone-scoped
plans** — approver wjlee. M6.5 carried the Rev 2 approval + the spike-STOP **Option A** decision;
M8 carried the Rev 3 approval with the **A1/A2/A3 advisory dispositions** (A3 — the
`.codex/.dmc-created` sentinel is committed, NEVER gitignored — was a MANDATORY implementation
directive, verified as-built by critic r4 + the verifier). **M7/M9/M10 remain UNAPPROVED**; each
needs its own milestone plan → critic → human gate
(pattern: milestone-scoped plan file, `dmc validate plan` VALID, critic APPROVE, approval record in both plans).
No active run: `.harness/runs/current-*` cleared after M8 closure; per-milestone run archives are local-only.
**M6 wired Ring-0 into the live enforcement floor** — the six hooks are now shims over `bin/dmc`
verdict CLIs; scope/stop/secret enforcement is no longer advisory. `.claude/settings.json` was NOT
changed (all five hooks were already registered); new hook registrations would need a session reload.

## M6 closure evidence (compact)

Full reports: `.harness/verification/dmc-v1-m6-hook-hardening.md` + `.harness/verification/dmc-run-53553ac50a20.md`.

- **Closure proof 1 (live `--all`)** — post-commit `bin/dmc selftest --all` on the real committed tree `d721487`
  exits 0 at legacy `tools=49 / PASS=802 / FAIL=3 / N/A=3` == pinned baseline EXACTLY (the 3 accepted FAILs are
  v0.1.3 GLM-grep · v0.2.3 V5 · v0.3.2 AC5); "originals alone still reproduce 802/3/3".
- **Closure proof 2 (single-revert restore)** — in a scratch git worktree (real repo untouched) `git revert d721487`
  restores `.claude/hooks/**` + `.claude/settings.json` byte-identical to pre-M6 `2999870` and removes the M6
  additions (e.g. `bin/lib/dmc-bash-radius.py` gone). NOTE: `tests/fixtures/m6/test-rollback.sh` run in-place reads
  25/5 **by design** (its "live matches fixture" rows now compare the committed M6 shims against the pre-M6 fixtures);
  the operative proof is the scratch-worktree revert above.
- **Critic chain (advisory only, C11)** — r1 REJECT (7 blockers B1–B7, plan_hash `06cd9495`) → Rev 2 → r2 APPROVE
  (`968cd191`, intermediate) → r3 APPROVE (`45c35fe9`, gated bytes) → approval record → human-gated Rev 3 amendment →
  r4 APPROVE (`8ce3c1c3`) → r5 build sign-off;
  persisted at `.harness/evidence/dmc-v1-m6-critic-verdict-r{1,2,3,4,5-buildsignoff}.json`.
- **Independent verifier (agent m6-verifier)** — ACCEPT: 0 blocking / 4 advisory (own probes + own committed-replica `--all`).
- **Green on the committed tree** — m6-core 99/0 (bash-radius 50 · postbash-diff 25 · verify-crosscheck 13 ·
  stop-gate 11) · m6-suite 104/0 (adversarial 38 · compat 45 · e2e-ultrawork 10 · restore 11) · run-core 168/0 ·
  mirror-check green (55-file byte-equality) · fast default 75/0.
- **Human gates honored (all via AskUserQuestion, approver wjlee)** — v0.5 direction plan · M6 milestone approval +
  T011.1 fixture-commit pre-auth · mid-run Rev 3 amendment · M6 staging/commit/push.

## Working pattern that shipped M3–M5 (keep it)

Orchestrator (**Fable 5** — direction, planning, orchestration, gate requests, and artifact
persistence ONLY; the orchestrator lane never implements) + worker agents (**Opus 4.8** complex/
security-critical / **Sonnet 5** mechanical; ALL subagents spawned with permission mode `auto` —
DMC Ring-0 guards enforce independently of harness permission mode) + independent non-authoring
critic (plan stage) and verifier (build stage) + committed-replica `--all` proof + post-commit live re-run as the
closure condition. Single-owner rule for `bin/dmc` (one sub-task registers all verbs/sections). Human gates every
time for: milestone approval, staging, commit, push. Evidence/verification per milestone; verification reports must
pass `dmc validate verification`.

## M6.5 closure evidence (compact)

Full reports: `.harness/verification/dmc-v1-m6.5-codex-adapter.md` (milestone, VALID + crosscheck
ACCEPT) + `.harness/verification/dmc-run-8fef31d58eee.md` (spike-phase run, ACCEPT) +
`.harness/evidence/dmc-v1-m6.5-build-20260707.md` (build evidence).

- **Two runs**: `dmc-run-8fef31d58eee` (spike, T011b.1) + `dmc-run-fe05b840460e` (build, 23-entry
  scope.lock, T011b.2–.5); both archived SUSPENDED; pointer cleared at closure.
- **Spike outcome (T011b.1, codex-cli 0.132.0, NO live turn/API key)**: hook firing + decision-envelope
  honoring UNPROVABLE-TURN-FREE (no headless hook surface) ⇒ B4 STOP artifact
  `.harness/evidence/dmc-v1-m6.5-spike-stop.md` → human gate chose **Option A**: ship ADVISORY shims;
  the Codex enforcement boundary is the pre-commit/CI gate; the M6 post-Bash diff guard is the
  PRIMARY Codex safety net; NO enforcement-parity claim. CONFIRMED turn-free: skills discovery,
  trusted-project `.codex` config merge, sandbox modes, AGENTS.md discovery + 32 KiB cap;
  hooks/multi_agent/unified_exec stable+on ([SPIKE-CORRECTED] in CODEX_ADAPTER §1).
- **Critic chain (advisory only, C11)** — `.harness/evidence/dmc-v1-m6.5-critic-verdict-r{1,2,3-buildsignoff}.json`:
  r1 REJECT (B1 task-ID renumber → DMC-T011b.1–.5 · B2 fail-closed negative controls · B3 secret-redaction
  binding · B4 turn-free-proof resolution; plan_hash `9d8562bd…`) → Rev 2 → r2 APPROVE (`b02b1554…`) →
  approval record (run.json binds post-append `8a74a525…`, carry-forward-9 pattern) → r3 build
  sign-off APPROVE (0 blockers).
- **Independent verifier ACCEPT** — own probes + own committed-replica `--all` at 802/3/3 EXACT;
  0 blocking / 2 advisory (static-floor maintenance coupling; model-name scan framing).
- **Disclosed build deviations (all honest, none blocking)**: active-mode fail-closed divergence vs
  Claude fail-open on malformed input (B2 mandate; proven by parity fixtures D11–D15); B2(c) N/A for
  in-process Read/Grep/Glob secret guard; `.codex/hooks.json` wiring shape unproven at 0.132.0
  (documented advisory); MIRRORED_SKILLS = the 5 plan-named workflow skills (worker-bridge skills
  excluded by design); `tool_input` field names TBD (superset read, renamed field ⇒ fail-closed).
- **Live-fire enforcement events THIS session**: scope-guard DENIED the orchestrator's own
  out-of-project memory write mid-run; bash-radius L1 denied `>/dev/null`- and `tee`-to-scratch
  write idioms and `cp`-to-scratch during replica builds (tar-pipe used instead); the stop gate HELD
  a session stop pre-verification (suspend = the designed wait-state); verify-crosscheck REFUSED a
  prose-formatted Run ID + undeclared dirty paths until the report/commit were made honest.

## M8 closure evidence (compact)

Full reports: `.harness/verification/dmc-v1-m8-host-install.md` (VALID; post-commit crosscheck
ACCEPT + stop-gate STOP-PASS) + `.harness/evidence/dmc-v1-m8-build-20260707.md`.

- **One run**: `dmc-run-03cba8c2797c` (14-entry scope.lock; installer/uninstaller/bin/dmc/doctor
  all landmark-authorized enforcement-class edits); archived SUSPENDED; pointer cleared at closure.
- **Critic chain** — `.harness/evidence/dmc-v1-m8-critic-verdict-r{1,2,3,4-buildsignoff}.json`:
  r1 REJECT (B1 detector-regex unpinned · B2 invalid `.gitignore` HTML markers · B3 self-contradictory
  doctor honesty grep · B4 `.codex` collision undefined · B5 manifest deletion loophole) → Rev 2 →
  r2 REJECT (B1–B5 closed; NEW B6 `.codex` provenance unimplementable under install→install→uninstall)
  → Rev 3 (receipt `.harness/install-receipt.json` + sentinel `# DMC-CREATED` provenance) →
  r3 APPROVE → human gate → build → r4 build sign-off APPROVE (fixtures independently re-run 126/0;
  A1/A2/A3 dispositions verified as-built).
- **Independent verifier ACCEPT** — own probes + own committed-replica `--all` at 802/3/3 EXACT;
  0 blocking / 5 advisory (crosscheck pre-commit hold; crosscheck basename self-exclusion sharp
  edge; runtime-materialized fixtures; 0644 script mode; A1 fallback residual).
- **Closure proof** — live post-commit `--all` on `39c420e`: legacy 802/3/3 EXACT,
  originals-alone reproduce, all sections 0 FAIL (doctor 24 · m8-suite 126 · m65-suite 119 ·
  m6-core 99 · m6-suite 104 · run-core 168 · loop-core 78 · …), SELFTEST-ALL PASS, exit 0.
- **Key shipped invariants**: hosts now receive Ring-0 (`bin/`) + `orchestration/` on every
  install; byte-clean install→uninstall round-trip proven on 5 fixture host shapes; `.codex`
  provenance (foreign skip-with-warn / DMC-owned re-affirm / signal-gated removal); `dmc doctor`
  reports Claude firing PROVEN (synthetic-event probe) vs Codex ADVISORY (never enforced-class —
  grep-enforced honesty); model names live ONLY in `orchestration/models.json` (display-only).

## Next step (M7 — worker/delegation hardening, per Rev 3 order M7→M9→M10)

**M7 needs its own milestone plan → critic → human gate.** It is a **PROTECTED SURFACE** milestone
(worker validators under `.claude/hooks/`: `worker-result-check.py`, `worker-context-guard.sh`) —
expect the HEAVY critic rotation (M6-grade), not the light M6.5/M8 rotation. Master plan §M7
(DMC-T012): token classes imported from oauth-cli detectors; rename/copy/binary diff parsing;
empty-allowed ⇒ DENY; task_id/provider cross-check; required-field presence; worker-context-guard
fail-closed on parse error; NEW `dmc worker review-check` validator; hash-chained
apply-authorization consumed by P7; post-apply fidelity; delegation records + subagent artifact
validation. Acceptance/rollback/evidence per master §M7 (~L318–322): canonical-five fixtures
(4)(5) + empty-allowed REJECT; v0.3.3 contract suite green unchanged; apply-without-chain refused;
INSTALL_MANIFEST drift re-run clean post-M7; rollback = revert commit with the pre-M7 validator
retained as fixture; evidence dmc-v1-m7-*.md. Not-edit: provider adapters/router (never) AND the
M6 hook surface. Because M7 edits worker
validators that the M8 installer now SHIPS, M7 must regenerate the INSTALL_MANIFEST worker-validator
entries (`dmc-install.sh --emit-manifest` re-run) and run a post-M7 manifest drift re-run. Note:
the M8 uninstaller strip-list bonus fix (worker-context-guard added to the settings.json `is_dmc()`
list) already landed in M8 — M7 must not double-touch the installer surface beyond the manifest
re-run. Task numbering: sub-number under DMC-T012 (grep first). M9 afterward is doubly load-bearing:
under Option A the pre-commit/CI gate IS the Codex enforcement boundary (documented-only today) —
M9 builds it real.

## Carry-forwards (do not lose)

1. 3 pinned upstream FAILs (v0.1.3 "GLM/worker code found" · v0.2.3 "V5 mock" · v0.3.2 "AC5") are HUMAN-ACCEPTED
   baseline (802/3/3); never "fix" or mask them inside another milestone — separate hygiene plan if ever.
2. M9 release gate MUST resolve approval `verification_ref` → artifact (M4's gate is presence-only by design;
   the honest-scope note is recorded in dmc-v1-m4 evidence + verification).
3. M9 CI model-name grep must scope to `orchestration/ .claude/agents/` or exempt `bin/lib/dmc-roles.py`
   (it legitimately carries detector patterns).
4. linkcheck covers machine-consumable refs only (code-span verbs / path literals / `Role:` bindings) —
   documented judgment call; prose-embedded dangling refs are unchecked.
5. verdict-gate is value-blind (C11): a plan-bound REJECT passes the *gate*; content judgment is the human's.
   **RESOLVED at M6** — `dmc run start` now adds a value floor (RUN-VERDICT-REJECT rc=3) that refuses to *arm a run*
   on a plan-bound critic REJECT (NEEDS_CLARIFICATION still arms); this only ADDS a floor, never opens the gate (C11 intact).
6. Auto-log local-only policy stands: `.harness/evidence/*.md` deliberate deliverables are committed;
   run archives under `.harness/runs/` stay local.
7. The two working-tree-drift legacy checks (v0.5.9 AC13 / v0.6.0 V15) FAIL `--all` whenever tracked files are
   modified uncommitted — expected artifact class; the committed-replica proof + post-commit re-run is the pattern.
8. Task-ID namespace collisions RESOLVED at the M6/M6.5 critic passes (verifier advisory finding 6): the M6
   plan renumbered its tasks to `DMC-T011.1–.4` (collision-free vs master §M6.5's `DMC-T011b`), and the M6.5
   plan Rev 2 renumbered `DMC-T012a–e` → `DMC-T011b.1 .. DMC-T011b.5` (sub-numbered under master §M6.5's own
   task `DMC-T011b`), removing the prefix collision with master §M7's `DMC-T012` and aligning the sub-plan to
   its own master task ID. `DMC-T011b.N` was grep-verified unused across `.harness/` and `docs/` before the
   rename. Validators still accept per-plan namespaces; these renames are for cross-plan legibility, applied
   per this carry-forward.
9. Critic R2 verdict for the direction plan binds the PRE-approval Rev 2 bytes (plan_hash `277ee35d…`); the
   current file hashes `a85c12db…` because the approval record was appended after — a naive re-hash "fails" by
   design; the chain (R2 → approval citing 277ee35d → run.json binding a85c12db) is documented in
   `.harness/verification/dmc-run-0e29d09bf3b5.md`.
10. **M6.5 residuals/advisories (disclosed, NONE blocking):** (a) critic-r3 advisory — the Codex
    PostToolUse evidence append truncates an Edit/Write `file_path` to 500 chars WITHOUT `redact()`
    (exact parity with the accepted Claude baseline `evidence-log.sh:73`); the A5 wording in the
    shim docstrings slightly over-claims the path-only deny's coverage — tighten wording and/or
    redact `file_path` + add a token-in-Edit-path fixture in a later hygiene pass; (b) verifier
    advisory — `_FLOORS` in `dmc_codex_common.py` is a faithful REPRODUCTION of the Claude shims'
    static floors, guarded against drift only by the D-series parity fixtures (maintenance
    coupling: a change to `pre-tool-guard.sh` floors must be mirrored or D-series fails); (c) the
    Codex enforcement boundary under Option A is the pre-commit/CI gate, which is currently
    DOCUMENTED-ONLY — M9 must make it real; (d) **Option B** (one-time, human-run, consented
    live-turn verification, NEW gate + own scope) remains available to upgrade the shims to
    verified-enforcing; (e) `.codex/hooks.json` wiring shape + per-tool `tool_input` field names
    remain UNPROVEN at codex-cli 0.132.0 — re-probe at the Option B turn or a newer CLI.
11. **M8 residuals/advisories (disclosed, NONE blocking):** (a) the `verify-crosscheck`
    basename self-exclusion is a latent sharp edge — a dirty file sharing the report's basename
    evades the undeclared-file flag (benign here, disclosed; harden in a later hygiene pass);
    (b) the A1 receipt-absent fallback removes fixed-name `dmc-*` bin/lib files — a host's own
    file named `dmc-something` would be misidentified (documented, gate-accepted trade-off);
    (c) merge-target byte restoration is proven for CANONICAL-form host files only — non-canonical
    hosts get SEMANTIC restoration (honestly hedged, never over-claimed); (d) M8 fixture host
    trees are materialized at runtime in mktemp (committed files = the 5 suite scripts only);
    suite scripts are mode 0644, invoked via `bash <script>`; (e) HOST-side directive shipped in
    the manifest: the `.codex/.dmc-created` sentinel must stay committed (never gitignored) for
    cross-clone provenance; (f) `dmc doctor` "hook firing PROVEN" applies to Claude only — the
    Codex column stays ADVISORY until Option B.
12. **M6 residuals (disclosed, verifier-confirmed real, NONE blocking; verifier ACCEPT flagged 4 as advisory):**
    (a) a broad `Grep` with no path can still read secret-file CONTENTS in a non-secret dir (pre-M6 residual,
    unchanged by M6); (b) run-id-armed-without-lock window — the stop gate arms on current-run-id but the write
    guards need the compiled `scope.lock`, so edits between `run start` and scope-compile fall to the legacy path;
    (c) evidence-log "run is now BLOCKED" wording over-claims if the marker write fails (the stop gate fail-closes
    independently, so enforcement is intact); (d) `.claude/settings.json` registration unchanged ⇒ any NEW hook
    registration needs a session reload; (e) the operative snapshot is pinned-not-recaptured by design and the
    bash-radius deny-message enumerates 4 basenames though `snapshot.txt` is enforced (cosmetic).
