# HANDOFF — dmc-v1-runtime-upgrade (session → session)

Date: 2026-07-06 (rev 4 — M6 protected-surface hardening shipped + CLOSED) · Branch: `claude/dmc-v1-runtime-upgrade-c5uch1`
Session end state: `HEAD` == `origin/claude/dmc-v1-runtime-upgrade-c5uch1` == `d721487` (pushed, fast-forward, no
force). M6 CLOSED with **both** closure proofs — (1) live `bin/dmc selftest --all` exit 0 at 802/3/3 EXACT
(originals alone still reproduce the pinned baseline), and (2) single-revert byte-identical restore (`git revert
d721487` in a scratch worktree restores `.claude/hooks/**` + `.claude/settings.json` byte-for-byte to pre-M6
`2999870` and removes the M6 additions). Worktree clean except local-only run archives/auto-logs
(`.harness/runs/**`, `.harness/evidence/dmc-run-*.md`, untracked by policy); `main` untouched
(`main` == `origin/main` == `d0edc48`).

Approval state (master plan `## Approval Status`): **APPROVED M2+M3+M4+M5 (M1 retroactively ratified)** —
approver wjlee; M6 approved via its own milestone plan (initial gate + mid-run Rev 3 amendment gate).
**M6.5+ remain UNAPPROVED**; each needs its own milestone plan → critic → human gate
(M4/M5 pattern: milestone-scoped plan file, `dmc validate plan` VALID, critic APPROVE, approval record in both plans).
No active run: `.harness/runs/current-*` cleared after M6 closure; per-milestone run archives are local-only.
**M6 wired Ring-0 into the live enforcement floor** — the six hooks are now shims over `bin/dmc`
verdict CLIs; scope/stop/secret enforcement is no longer advisory. `.claude/settings.json` was NOT
changed (all five hooks were already registered); new hook registrations would need a session reload.

## M6 closure evidence (compact)

Full reports: `.harness/verification/dmc-v1-m6-hook-hardening.md` + `.harness/verification/dmc-run-53553ac50a20.md`.

- **Closure proof 1 (live `--all`)** — post-commit `bin/dmc selftest --all` on the real committed tree `d721487`
  exits 0 at legacy `tools=49 / PASS=802 / FAIL=3 / N/A=3` == pinned baseline EXACTLY (the 3 accepted FAILs are
  v0.1.3 GLM-grep · v0.2.3 V5 · v0.3.2 AC5); "originals alone still reproduce 802/3/3".
- **Closure proof 2 (single-revert restore)** — in a scratch git worktree (real repo untouched) `git revert d721487`
  restores `.claude/hooks/**` + `.claude/settings.json` byte-identical to pre-M6 `2999870` and removes the M6
  additions (e.g. `bin/lib/dmc-bash-radius.py` gone). NOTE: `tests/fixtures/m6/test-rollback.sh` run in-place reads
  25/5 **by design** (its "live matches fixture" rows now compare the committed M6 shims against the pre-M6 fixtures);
  the operative proof is the scratch-worktree revert above.
- **Critic chain (advisory only, C11)** — r1 REJECT (7 blockers B1–B7, plan_hash `06cd9495`) → Rev 2 → r2 APPROVE
  (`968cd191`, intermediate) → r3 APPROVE (`45c35fe9`, gated bytes) → approval record → human-gated Rev 3 amendment →
  r4 APPROVE (`8ce3c1c3`) → r5 build sign-off;
  persisted at `.harness/evidence/dmc-v1-m6-critic-verdict-r{1,2,3,4,5-buildsignoff}.json`.
- **Independent verifier (agent m6-verifier)** — ACCEPT: 0 blocking / 4 advisory (own probes + own committed-replica `--all`).
- **Green on the committed tree** — m6-core 99/0 (bash-radius 50 · postbash-diff 25 · verify-crosscheck 13 ·
  stop-gate 11) · m6-suite 104/0 (adversarial 38 · compat 45 · e2e-ultrawork 10 · restore 11) · run-core 168/0 ·
  mirror-check green (55-file byte-equality) · fast default 75/0.
- **Human gates honored (all via AskUserQuestion, approver wjlee)** — v0.5 direction plan · M6 milestone approval +
  T011.1 fixture-commit pre-auth · mid-run Rev 3 amendment · M6 staging/commit/push.

## Working pattern that shipped M3–M5 (keep it)

Orchestrator (human-gated) + worker agents (Opus 4.8 complex / Sonnet 5 mechanical) + independent non-authoring
critic (plan stage) and verifier (build stage) + committed-replica `--all` proof + post-commit live re-run as the
closure condition. Single-owner rule for `bin/dmc` (one sub-task registers all verbs/sections). Human gates every
time for: milestone approval, staging, commit, push. Evidence/verification per milestone; verification reports must
pass `dmc validate verification`.

## Next step (critic pass + human gate first)

**M6.5 — Codex Adapter** (DRAFT plan `.harness/plans/dmc-v1-m6.5-codex-adapter.md`, schema-VALID; NOT a
protected surface). M6 shipped, so the shim interfaces are now frozen — the deferred critic pass is UNBLOCKED.
Next action: critic pass on the M6.5 plan → human gate → implement. Its Ring-0 verdict-CLI surface to bind
onto (frozen at M6 closure `d721487`): `dmc bash-radius`, `dmc postbash-diff`, `dmc verify-crosscheck`,
`dmc stop-gate quick`, `dmc run block|blocked-status|unblock`, plus the existing `dmc verdict gate`,
`dmc run start` (arming floor), and the scope-lock/adjudicate path. Spike-first —
re-prove the web-verified 2026-07-06 Codex surface on a local CLI before any build (Codex hooks are officially
"a guardrail, not a complete enforcement boundary", so the post-Bash diff guard + release gate stay load-bearing);
installer/`--host` generation stays in M8. Design authority: `docs/CODEX_ADAPTER.md`. Execution order (Rev 3):
M6 → M6.5 → M8 → M7 → M9 → M10.

## Carry-forwards (do not lose)

1. 3 pinned upstream FAILs (v0.1.3 "GLM/worker code found" · v0.2.3 "V5 mock" · v0.3.2 "AC5") are HUMAN-ACCEPTED
   baseline (802/3/3); never "fix" or mask them inside another milestone — separate hygiene plan if ever.
2. M9 release gate MUST resolve approval `verification_ref` → artifact (M4's gate is presence-only by design;
   the honest-scope note is recorded in dmc-v1-m4 evidence + verification).
3. M9 CI model-name grep must scope to `orchestration/ .claude/agents/` or exempt `bin/lib/dmc-roles.py`
   (it legitimately carries detector patterns).
4. linkcheck covers machine-consumable refs only (code-span verbs / path literals / `Role:` bindings) —
   documented judgment call; prose-embedded dangling refs are unchecked.
5. verdict-gate is value-blind (C11): a plan-bound REJECT passes the *gate*; content judgment is the human's.
   **RESOLVED at M6** — `dmc run start` now adds a value floor (RUN-VERDICT-REJECT rc=3) that refuses to *arm a run*
   on a plan-bound critic REJECT (NEEDS_CLARIFICATION still arms); this only ADDS a floor, never opens the gate (C11 intact).
6. Auto-log local-only policy stands: `.harness/evidence/*.md` deliberate deliverables are committed;
   run archives under `.harness/runs/` stay local.
7. The two working-tree-drift legacy checks (v0.5.9 AC13 / v0.6.0 V15) FAIL `--all` whenever tracked files are
   modified uncommitted — expected artifact class; the committed-replica proof + post-commit re-run is the pattern.
8. Task-ID namespace collisions RESOLVED at the M6/M6.5 critic passes (verifier advisory finding 6): the M6
   plan renumbered its tasks to `DMC-T011.1–.4` (collision-free vs master §M6.5's `DMC-T011b`), and the M6.5
   plan Rev 2 renumbered `DMC-T012a–e` → `DMC-T011b.1 .. DMC-T011b.5` (sub-numbered under master §M6.5's own
   task `DMC-T011b`), removing the prefix collision with master §M7's `DMC-T012` and aligning the sub-plan to
   its own master task ID. `DMC-T011b.N` was grep-verified unused across `.harness/` and `docs/` before the
   rename. Validators still accept per-plan namespaces; these renames are for cross-plan legibility, applied
   per this carry-forward.
9. Critic R2 verdict for the direction plan binds the PRE-approval Rev 2 bytes (plan_hash `277ee35d…`); the
   current file hashes `a85c12db…` because the approval record was appended after — a naive re-hash "fails" by
   design; the chain (R2 → approval citing 277ee35d → run.json binding a85c12db) is documented in
   `.harness/verification/dmc-run-0e29d09bf3b5.md`.
10. **M6 residuals (disclosed, verifier-confirmed real, NONE blocking; verifier ACCEPT flagged 4 as advisory):**
    (a) a broad `Grep` with no path can still read secret-file CONTENTS in a non-secret dir (pre-M6 residual,
    unchanged by M6); (b) run-id-armed-without-lock window — the stop gate arms on current-run-id but the write
    guards need the compiled `scope.lock`, so edits between `run start` and scope-compile fall to the legacy path;
    (c) evidence-log "run is now BLOCKED" wording over-claims if the marker write fails (the stop gate fail-closes
    independently, so enforcement is intact); (d) `.claude/settings.json` registration unchanged ⇒ any NEW hook
    registration needs a session reload; (e) the operative snapshot is pinned-not-recaptured by design and the
    bash-radius deny-message enumerates 4 basenames though `snapshot.txt` is enforced (cosmetic).
